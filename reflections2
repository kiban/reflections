## How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
## efficient programmer in the long run?

Right now I'm wondering if this is something I can use in IPython. I created soo many 
different versions of functions, it became a mess. Way too much copy and pasting and 
trying to undo, slight changes. Also was just plain ugly to look at, and made the files
much bigger than they needed to be. 

So if I can keep things more organized, cleaner, but this should also let me iterate faster and more efficiently.
