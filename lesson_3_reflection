# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
# your work local?

When I want to collaborate with others on a project. To display my work.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
# Git automatically stay up-to-day with your remote repository?

There may only be certain parts of the repository that you're working on. You
might not want the most up to date version of the repository for some reason,
maybe there's been a new update that your're not sure about or an update
that's not stable.
